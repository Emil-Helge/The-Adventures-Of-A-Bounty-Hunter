# An interactive text based experience

I have created the first chapter for a text based interactive experience that presents the user with different choices
throughout the journey. The plot for the first chapter, named 'Prison Break' is about a young bounty hunter that has been imprisoned for
a crime that they did not commit and your objective as the user is to guide them to freedom.
